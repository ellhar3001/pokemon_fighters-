# pokemon_fighters-

Hello! 

Pokemon Fighters is an interactive text based game that I created using the PokeAPI and google colab.

The aim of the game is to win as many matches as possible! The game starts by selecting a pokemon, and you then battle with the computer until you or the computer run out of HP. At this point the game is over or you continue to the next round. 

The aim of the project was to practise using APIS alongside of improving my knowledge of OOP in python. 

I hope you enjoy
